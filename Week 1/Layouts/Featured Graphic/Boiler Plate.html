I can't see the ants from over here, I just assumed that was um.. Turd Man, Wiggly Turd Man. Letâ€™s be post-apocalyptic scavengerrrrsss! Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the Megaseeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake. Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack. I do not have discolored butthole flaps. You don't know me! Ohh, fuck! Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?</p></div>

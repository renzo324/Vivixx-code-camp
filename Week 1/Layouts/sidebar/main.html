			<p>Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover. My sister died in the spaghetti. Not today bitch! You don't have to try to impress me Morty. It's a device Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams Morty. Its just like that movie that you keep crowing about. Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. Existence is pain to a meeseeks Jerry, and we will do anything to alleviate that pain. You can run, but you can't hide bitch!

Sometimes science is a lot more art, than science. A lot of people don't get that. There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. Aw, man! I really liked this life! Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. Ooohhh can do. Are these pills supposed to wake me up or something? What the fuck is going on?! I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue. Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up.

They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo. I do not have discolored butthole flaps. Haha god-damn! It's not like we can do this every week, we get 3 or 4 more of these tops. Man, that guy is the Red Grin Grumbold of pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference? Well guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep. Nice one, Ms Pancakes. Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor!

Snuffles was my slave name. You can call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. Get off the high road Summer. We all got pink eye because you wouldn't stop texting on the toilet. The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk. Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. I can finally go on that trip I've been talking about. They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times! Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.

Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady. The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk. Morty! The principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way! We all wanna die, we're meeseeks! Rick, is this a Saw thing? Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators? What is this, 90's Conan? Well he roped me into this! Flip the pickle over.

This is Principal Vagina. No relation. He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle. A price for everything. Uh ohhh! Somersault jump! Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck those people, fuck this whole thing Ethan.

If it were, you could call ME Ernest Hemingway. Nothing you do matters, your existence is a lie! They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times! S-S-Samantha. Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it. We're gonna nine eleven this bitch unless Morty gets better math grades! Looossseeerrrrr.

Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before—I'm a pickle! I'm Pickle Ri-i-i-ick! Hello Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? My name is Slip- Slippery Stair. I'll take ya down there for 25 shmeckels! I wish that shotgun was my penis. Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. ...and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together... Get your shit together. Want to piss on him? Nice to wheat you!

I don't get it, and I don't need to. Not for the men they cheat on. Right, Crocubot. So, you're half cold unfeeling reptile, half also cold equally unfeeling machine? They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! That's Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know. It's gonna make sense. I'm Mr. Crowbar, and here is my friend, who is also a crowbar! Sometimes science is a lot more art, than science. A lot of people don't get that. Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?

Ooohhh can do. Hmmm, human music. Not for the men they cheat on. It probably has space aids. I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please. high chair, no no no recliner... and wheelchair on half. God, Grandpa, you're such a dick. Cause he roped me into this! You can run, but you can't hide bitch!

No jumping in the sewer! Flip the pickle over. Well he roped me into this! Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants from over here, I just assumed that was um.. Turd Man, Wiggly Turd Man. Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty! Just do the same thing here and we'll be fine! Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. Nice, Mrs Pancakes. Real nice. Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover.

I just wanna die! Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! He's not a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it. If you break the rules, try to leave or lose the game, you will die. Just like Saaaaw.

What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. Well he roped me into this! I know you're real because i have a ton of bad memories with you. Quote mode. Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carp'en all them 'diems. That guy is the Red Grin Grumbold of pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference? Well guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.

Don't be trippin dog we got you. Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before—I'm a pickle! I'm Pickle Ri-i-i-ick! We will return… possibly in different clothing. Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. ...and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together... Get your shit together. Puffy vagina. You know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck those people, fuck this whole thing Ethan. And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it.

I'm sorry, Morty, it's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back. So now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty. Because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important. And they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty. And you're gonna be part of them. And together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna- do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever a hundred times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. www.rickandmorty.com. www.rickandmortyadventures. All 100 years every minute, rickandmorty.com. www.100timesrickandmorty.com. Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it. We are created to serve a singular purpose, for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Okay, take it easy Rick. T-that's dark. Slow down! I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones please. cell phone, no no no rotary... and payphone on half.
